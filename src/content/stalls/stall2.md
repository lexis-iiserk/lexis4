A crowd favourite of Lexis 3.0, Spin the Wheel is back! In a hangman-inspired game, STW players will have to guess a phrase for a given topic within a fixed amount of time—too many wrong guesses, and game over.

### Rules:
+ Players will first spin the wheel to land on a category to guess. The categories are authors and poets, books and poems, idioms and phrases. (others can also be added)
+ Based on the category, words will appear on the screen, but the letters will not be visible to the participant.
+ Participants will have 20 seconds to guess all the letters of the phrase/idiom, author’s/poet’s name or poem/book title with a maximum of 10 wrong guesses.
+ If participants guess correctly, they will get the chance to spin the wheel to land on a prize.
+ Players might land on a spoke with no prizes, so all the best and may the odds be in your favour!
+ (Note: If players want to play again, they will have to pay an additional 10 rupees each time. First round free, second round 10 rupees, 3rd round 20 rupees and so on)
+ The amount will be collected in Adrika Chaudhuri's (core committee member) account and will be transferred to the institute's account for the next edition of Lexis.

### Prizes:
- **Lexis merchandise:** Bookmarks, badges, magnets, keychains.
- **Bumper prize:** Mugs
