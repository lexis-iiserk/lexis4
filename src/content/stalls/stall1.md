A five-letter word is chosen which players aim to guess within six tries. After
every guess, each letter is marked as either green, yellow or gray: green indicates that the
letter is correct and in the correct position, yellow means it is in the answer but not in the
right position, while gray indicates it is not in the answer at all. Multiple instances of the same
letter in a guess, such as the “o"s in “robot”, will be colored green or yellow only if the letter
also appears multiple times in the answer; otherwise, excess repeating letters will be colored
gray. The less number of tries you get the word in, the better it is.

### Entry Fees: 
Rs. 15 for 3 tries

### Rules: 
The leaderboard is based on time. But there's a twist, every wrong guess gets 30 seconds added to the time. The top of the leaderboard at the end of every hour gets a mug. 

**Hints are available:** If you want to know a letter, you can do so for a cost of 30 seconds on the clock. If you want to know the position of a letter you have already got, that would cost you 15 seconds.
