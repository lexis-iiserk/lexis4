A five-letter word is chosen which players aim to guess within six tries. After
every guess, each letter is marked as either green, yellow or gray: green indicates that the
letter is correct and in the correct position, yellow means it is in the answer but not in the
right position, while gray indicates it is not in the answer at all. Multiple instances of the same
letter in a guess, such as the “o"s in “robot”, will be colored green or yellow only if the letter
also appears multiple times in the answer; otherwise, excess repeating letters will be colored
gray. The less number of tries you get the word in, the better it is.

### Entry Fees: 
Rs. 15 for 3 tries

### Rules: 
There’ll be a leaderboard for each session (one hour long) the top three can claim their
reward after the session ends. The judging will be based on the number of guesses. The time
taken is considered if they have the same number of guesses. One can play multiple times.
There is also a Grand Prize for the best gameplay by the end of the event.
