Lexis 4.0 at IISER Kolkata wouldn’t be complete without a science event, and what could be
more fitting than a science fiction event? We present Sci-fi, the science fiction event of IISERK.
An immersive semi-online event, Sci-fi, welcomes all to unleash their creativity in the realm
of science fiction. Whether it’s crafting captivating stories, compelling screen-plays, or even
building your very own world, Sci-fi offers a gateway to uncharted territories of imagination.
### How it will go:
1. Participants will be given a sequence of four or more images. Their task is to write a
long story connecting these pictures . Entries will be judges based on how uniquely they in-
corporated the essence of the images. (word limit - 1000 words). This is a solo event. ([**Submit Here**](https://forms.gle/16FHi1fxoKr37W2P9))
2. Short worldbuilding exercise in joining two entirely disjoint genres - write a brief POV
of a person living in a world that incorporates the two genres. What does a day in their life
typically sound like? What adventures do they get up to? The genres will be available in pairs,
which will then be chosen by the Let your imagination have no bounds! (word limit - 500
words). This is also a solo event. ([**Submit Here**](https://forms.gle/b1CPXWCCeVVRGnWn6))

3. Screenplay exercise in pitching the pilot of a Sci-Fi TV Show before the production team
at the Institute of Science Fiction and Research. The judges will judge based on a table
read that exceeds no more than 15 minutes. If the number of participants is more than 8,
a pre-evaluation will be done based on the scripts submitted. This is a team event with 5
members at most. ([**Submit Here**](https://forms.gle/zzsv8hRxdGu8pjSKA))

**All the events will have individual winners.**
