As an institute committed to the pursuit of truth, War of Words, Lexisâ€™ famed debate event,
tests the mettle of ideas and the debaters defending them. With a plethora of spicy topics to
choose from, this event will surely have you on the edge of your seats.
### Event Outline:
1. The debate will take place in either a Lincoln-Douglas or a Cross-Examination format
(depending on participant turnout).
2. For the topics, we plan to send a mail to all members of the IISER-K community, seeking
to find the topics they wish to see debated. To this list, several topics will be appended
by the EO. The final list will then be decided by either public vote or by Lexis Organizers.
The final list of topics will then be sent to all and participants will be able to choose
which topics they want to debate over.
3. The event will be judged both by selected judges (IISER-K profs) and the audience (finer
details on this will be provided later).
