The Reading Room was one of the most praised aspect of Lexis last year and we plan to give
the people what they want. A cozy reading nook where everyone is welcome to read their
favorite books. We give you the ambience, you just relax!
Outline of the event:
1. Books will be available in the reading room (donated by students) - so that it is not nec-
essary for people to carry their own books.
2. If someone carries their own book they will have to enter their book in a book/paper at
the main counter where volunteers will keep track of this list.
3. Volunteers will keep an eye on the people inside the room at all times to ensure there
are no problems and avoid external disturbances (by keeping the door closed).
4. The room will be decorated suitably to give the ambience of it being a “cozy reading
nook”.
