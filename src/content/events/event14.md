The Reading Room Returns!<br/>

One of the most cherished parts of Lexis last year is back — the Reading Room. A warm, cozy space designed for every book lover to unwind, read, and escape into stories. Soft lights, comfortable cushions, and shelves full of books will set the perfect mood for peaceful reading.
## Event Outline:
- Books will be available in the Reading Room, donated by students, so it isn’t necessary to carry your own.

- If someone brings their own book, it must be registered at the main counter. Volunteers will maintain a record of all such entries.

- Volunteers will stay inside the room to ensure a calm environment and prevent any external disturbances.

- The door will remain closed during the session to maintain the quiet, cozy ambience.

- The room will be decorated to create the feel of a true reading nook — soft lighting, warm tones, and comfortable seating.

**Readers are encouraged to leave short notes or mini-reviews in the books they read — small messages to connect one reader to another.**

Come, relax, and lose yourself in the pages — the Reading Room is waiting for you.
