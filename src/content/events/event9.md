Step into the arena where arguments clash and ideas ignite — War of Words is back!
This is your chance to test your wit, logic, and oratory against some of the sharpest minds around. Whether you’re a fiery debater or a keen listener who loves a good intellectual duel, this event promises a battle of perspectives, persuasion, and passion.

- Expect heated discussions, clever rebuttals, and powerful speeches as participants go head-to-head to claim the title of the ultimate word warrior.

- Participants will get 10 minutes after the declaration of the debate topic and then the debate will start. If there are very few participants (≤6) we will follow the Lincoln-Douglas Format. If there are more than 8 participants, we will follow the Cross Examination Style of Debate with teams of two each. 

Come for the arguments, stay for the thrill — because in War of Words, every sentence counts and every pause can change the game.
