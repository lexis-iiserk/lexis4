Welcome to Just a Minute! A game that’s all about quick thinking and smooth
talking, where all you have to do is speak non-stop for 60 seconds on a given
topic without hesitation, repetition, or deviation. It's as fun as it sounds, and a
great way to test your wits!
## Prelims:
In case there are more than 16 willing to play, we will have prelims. It will be a short written round.
### Rules of the game (Finals):
1. The host shall give the players a random topic. Immediately after the
announcement, the 60 seconds timer is started.
2. The player shall keep on speaking on the topic until one of his opponents
raises a challenge (vide (10)) or the 60 seconds timer runs out, whichever
comes first.
3. The raised challenge must be an accurate one. Accusing Hesitation when
in reality the speaker deviated from the topic will not be counted as a
successful challenge.
4. If the challenge is granted (denied), then the challenger gains 5 points
(loses 5 points) and the challenger now continues as the speaker (original
speaker continues speaking).
5. The rest of the players must now again be on the lookout for challenging
the current speaker.
6. Each speaker scores points corresponding to the time (in
seconds.milliseconds) that they speak.
7. Repeat (2)-(6)
8. At the end of 60 seconds of game-time, total scores (from challenges and
the speaking time) shall be added.
9. After four (or three, depending on the number of players) rounds, the
winner of the game is the player who scores the most points over all
rounds in a game.
10. A challenge could include any of the following
    - Hesitation: Any sort of obvious hesitation from the speaker’s end. No “umm”, “uhh” or long pauses.
    - Repetition: Repetition could include repetition of words, repetition of ideas, or repetition of phrases. Common words like pronouns, conjunctions and articles are allowed, and do not count as repetition. However, overly obvious abuse of this freedom can be challenged, and may be ruled against the speaker. However, anything on the topic card can be repeated.
    - Deviation: Deviation could include any of the following:
        - Grammatical Deviation: Any grammatical error.
        - Factual Deviation: Any idea presented that is factually incorrect.
        - Deviation from topic: Yapping about something not in the topic.

### Format 

(assuming 16 participants, so tentative and may be slightlychanged):
1. Games will be played in groups of four at a time.
2. In Round 1 four games of four players each will play. This is the seeding
round. The players’ standings in their respective games in this round will
be their seed numbers for the next round. Fourth seed (last place finishers)
is eliminated here.
3. In Round 2,
- First seeds from round 1 play against each other. Top two go to
Finals, and the third place enters the repechage. Fourth place is
eliminated.
- Second seeds from round 1 play against each other. Top two enter
the repechage. Final two are eliminated.
- Third seeds from round 1 play against each other. First place enters
the repechage. Rest all are eliminated.
4. Round 3 is the Repechage. Top two from this match qualify for the finals.
