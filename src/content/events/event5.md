Adapted from the wildly popular BBC show, Just a Minute is a game which requires participants to speak on a given subject for a minute without hesitation, repetition or deviation. Participants may interrupt the speaker for bonus points in case they detect one of these errors being made. A player who makes a correct challenge takes over the subject for the remainder of the minute, or until they are successfully challenged.
