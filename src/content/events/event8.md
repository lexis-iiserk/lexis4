Mad Ads is a fun, spontaneous advertising challenge where creativity takes center stage! Participants are given a random everyday object and a few props on the spot. Their task? To create and perform a hilarious, catchy, and convincing advertisement for that objectâ€”right there, in front of the judges and audience.
With limited preparation time, teams must think on their feet, invent slogans, and act out their ads using imagination, wit, and teamwork. The wilder the idea, the better the show!
