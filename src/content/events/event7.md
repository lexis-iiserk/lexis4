Everyone imagines the protagonist differently. How do you imagine the friends they make?
The obstacles they face? How you imagine their story? Share it with us! Illustrate a short story,
any moment that you believe can be improved with art. Prizes await those who capture their
imaginations!

How it goes:
- Individual participation.
- Art supplies will be provided.
- Participants get 3 hours to make their illustration (they can arrive at venue at any time but submission deadline is fixed).
- Participants will receive an original short story (same for all).
- Each participant must make one illustration relevant to the story.
- Online references are allowed.
