What happens when your stream of thoughts is not the only one that contributes to the development of the story?
Do you have what it takes to work with your teammates, understand them and work together to produce a coherent story?
Twist in the plot: no discussions allowed! Take part in this exciting event and see where your story takes your team.
Winning or losing aside, this event promises to be an engaging, fun experience for everyone.

### Details:

1. Participation will be in teams of 3.
2. An initial prompt will be given to the team (no discussion amongst themselves will be allowed).
3. The first person will start writing and when a given time slot ends, they hand over the sheet to the next person of the team.
4. The next person must read the content written by the previous team-member/s and continue the story until they pass it on to participant 3 after their time slot ends.
5. This sequence continues with the introduction of certain new prompts intermediately.
6. The participants will be informed when the last round begins and they must end their stories accordingly.
7. The stories will be judged based on their coherence, language, themes and relevance to the prompts.
