Verse, the on-spot poetry and recitation competition of Lexis 4.0, invites one and all to cel-
ebrate the magic of poetry. Paint vivid pictures with your verses, and let your imagination
run wild. Whether you are experienced or want to write your first poem, you are welcome
to participate in this event to express your creativity and thoughts. Listen to your inner poet
and join us at Verse to create an unforgettable journey together.
### How it will go:
1. The competition will be in two parts: a writing round followed by a recitation round.
Participants will be given 40 mins to write an original poem on the spot based on a theme
chosen by them(randomly via chits) and then recite what they wrote.
2. Languages allowed for the competition are English, Hindi and Bengali. (for now)
3. The participants will be evaluated based on their ideas, expression, clarity of thought and
relevance to the theme.
4. Participants who regularly write or are involved in poetry recitation are welcome to
share their favourite poems with the crowd(original or reproductions) and will not be
evaluated based on them if time permits.
