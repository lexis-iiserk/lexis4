# Verse: The Poetry & Recitation Competition 
"Unleash your inner poet" <br/>
Verse, the on-spot poetry writing and recitation competition of Lexis 5.0, invites you to celebrate the rhythm, emotion, and artistry of words. Whether you’re a seasoned poet or penning your first verse, this event is your stage to explore creativity, imagination, and expression. Let your thoughts take flight, paint vivid pictures with language, and experience the magic of poetry like never before.

## Event Format
The competition unfolds in two rounds:
1. Writing Round – Participants will have 40 minutes to compose an original poem based on a theme assigned randomly through chits.
2. Recitation Round – Participants will then recite their written poem before the audience and judges, bringing their words to life through voice, tone, and emotion.

**Languages Allowed: English, Hindi, and Bengali**

Participants who regularly write or enjoy poetry recitation are also welcome to share their favourite pieces (original or reproduced) with the audience, time permitting.

## Judging Criteria:
Our panel of judges will evaluate participants on the following parameters:
- Relevance to the theme
- Creativity, style, and originality
- Clarity of imagery and language
- Stage presence and presentation (including intonation) 
- Clarity of spoken words and diction
**Three winners will be selected based on overall performance and artistic impact.**

## Why Participate?
Because Verse isn’t just a competition — it’s a celebration of poetry, passion, and performance. Come be part of a community that listens, feels, and applauds the power of words. Join us at Lexis 5.0, IISER Kolkata, and let your verses echo beyond the page."
