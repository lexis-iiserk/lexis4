What happens when your thoughts aren’t the only ones shaping a story? In this exciting and creative challenge, teams of three will collaboratively craft a story based on given prompts—but without any discussion. Each participant continues from where the previous one left off, building on their teammates’ ideas while adapting to unexpected twists introduced through new prompts. The final round will signal the story’s conclusion, and entries will be judged on coherence, language, creativity, and relevance to the prompts. A fun, unpredictable event that celebrates teamwork and imagination!
