Song lyrics are more than just words and melodies—they carry powerful meanings that often go unnoticed. They give voice to unspoken emotions, reflect societal truths, and ignite the spark for change. Some songs uplift with hope, while others explore inner struggles or offer profound insights, reminding us that music can inspire, heal, and transform lives. 

Decoded lyrics is a writing competition where participants explore the meaning, imagery, and emotions behind song lyrics. The challenge is to interpret the song's message through a creative piece of writing, inspired by the song!
