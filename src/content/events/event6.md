Who said ads can't be crazy?? Is there any restriction to how creative one can be?? In fact the madness of creativity often comes out when we hardly have time to think! Engage with us in this acting cum advertising event of Mad Ads: 'Act, Advertise, Improvise'.
### Details

1. Teams with 2 to 4 people can participate.
2. Registrations shall be conducted on spot, on the day of event itself.
3. Topics shall be provided to the teams on spot.
4. Topics shall be names of products: eg: “Headphones”. One needs to advertise the product for what it's not generally used for, eg: "Headphones that can hear people's thoughts!"
5. Enactment starts from: 3:25 pm sharp.
6. The skit should be at least 30 seconds and at most 3 minutes.
7. There’s no restriction on how creative or humorous one can be in presenting the ads. However vulgarity can lead to disqualification based on the judge’s discretion.

### Judging
Credit will be given to creativity, clarity, appropriate use of tagline, script and presentation.
