To seek new ways to write, to search for our most creative sources, we need to hold our initial
impulses back. You may have wanted to write something but do not know where to begin. Af-
ter all, it seems anything at all can be written down. But, come and embrace the limitations to
find what indeed emerges from within. Join us in finding springs of inspiration in constraints
and rules and in becoming rats who construct the labyrinth from which they plan to escape.
### Rules:
1. All participants are provided with a piece of paper and pens. Each participant is also
given one sticky note per round.
2. Each round involves a constraint or writing prompt, which has to be used, and a final
piece has to be written on a sticky note. The paper can be used for brainstorming.
3. Each round lasts 5 minutes, and a total of 10 rounds will be held.
4. At the end of each round, all the sticky notes will be posted on a poster board.
