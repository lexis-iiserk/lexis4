This LEXIS staple is designed to show us your quick-wittedness. In the preliminary round, a
picture will be shown to the participant. They start off giving a positive/negative interpreta
tion of the picture, and each time the moderator says switch, you change to negative/positive.
Total time to speak per person will be 30 seconds. Max. 2 switches. A demo will be given
for this.
### Finals: 
The finalists will be playing a game of PowerPoint karaoke: They must deliver a pre
sentation based on a set of slides they have never seen before. Judges will choose winners
based on relevant criteria (creativity, clarity, appropriateness, and persuasiveness, among
other things.)
