Can you find something happy in a desolate painting of a desert? Or something sad in a wholesome portrait of a reunion? In Impromptu, we shall try to see two sides of a coin in each picture. This event will test your ability to improvise on conventional interpretations of the world and let your tongue run loose. Who knows-you may surprise yourself by the uniqueness of the ideas you bring, ideas nobody else would ever have seen! Join us, and show us a different way of looking at things.
### Prelims
In the preliminary round, a picture will be shown to the participant. They start off giving a positive/negative interpretation of the picture, and each time the moderator says switch, you change to negative/positive. Total time to speak per person will be 30 seconds. Max. 2 switches. A demo will be given for this.
### Finals
The finalists will be playing a game of PowerPoint karaoke: They must deliver a presentation based on a set of slides they have never seen before. Judges will choose winners based on relevant criteria (creativity, clarity, appropriateness, and persuasiveness, among other things.)
