# Impromptu - A Lexis Classic
Get ready for a whirlwind of wit, words, and spontaneity! Impromptu is all about thinking on your feet and speaking from your heart — instantly. Contestants will be tested on their fluency, creativity, confidence, coherence, and ability to connect ideas in real time.
## Round 1: The Elimination Round
Each contestant steps onto the stage and is shown an image on the screen for 10 seconds. After that, they must speak about the image for 30 seconds, and when the moderator prompts 'Switch!', they must instantly change their narrative or perspective. The total speaking time is 1 minute 10 seconds per participant. This round tests quick thinking, adaptability, and presence of mind.
## Round 2: The Finals – PowerPoint Karaoke
In this exciting round, two finalists are randomly paired. Each team will receive a theme revealed right before their presentation. They’ll then present a PowerPoint of 10–12 slides, taking turns every slide (5–6 slides each). Each speaker gets 30–45 seconds per slide. This round tests team coordination, creativity, humour, and the ability to improvise a coherent presentation on the spot.
